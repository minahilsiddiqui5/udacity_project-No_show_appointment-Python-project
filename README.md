# No_show_appointment-Python-project
Overview
This project aims to analyze and gain insights from the "No-Show Appointment Data." The dataset contains information about medical appointments and whether or not patients showed up for their appointments. By exploring this data, we seek to understand the factors that influence appointment attendance and potentially improve healthcare appointment scheduling.
